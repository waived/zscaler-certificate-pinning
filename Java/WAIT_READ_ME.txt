For this certificate pinning method, you may be asked to enter in a password once or
more than once. This is because Java and Java-based compilers and IDEs make use of a
binary file called "cacerts" which requires a password to be modified.

This is NOT your account password nor the password for the local/system administrator.

Unless you or your organization has changed the password, the password is literally "changeit"
without the double-quotes.
